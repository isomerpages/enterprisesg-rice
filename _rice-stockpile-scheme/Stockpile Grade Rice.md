**What is Stockpile Grade Rice?**

| |
| -------- | 
| 1. White Rice*
2. Parboiled Rice
3. Ponni Rice
4. Basmati Rice 

*White Rice refers to all type of rice that is white, without having other ingredients added.

**For Non-Stockpile Grade Rice**

All other types of rice such as Glutinous Rice, Brown Rice, Red Rice and otherÂ rice that do not fall within the scope of stockpile grade rice, are not considered Stockpile Grade Rice. Hence, the business entity/company does not need to participate in the RSS. 

However, a licence is still required to import the rice into Singapore.  Refer [here](/rice-licences/permalink) for more information on such Rice Licences available.
