**What is Prescribed Stockpile Quantity (PSQ)?**
   

Prescribed Stockpile Quantity (PSQ) is the quantity of rice that all stockpile participants are obliged to keep in the government-designated warehouses. The Rice Stockpile belongs to the individual stockpile participant, although the Government has the right to acquire the rice (with compensation) during an emergency. 

Apart from the Prescribed Stockpile Quantity that is kept in the government-designated warehouse, the stockpile participants may keep their trading stocks at warehouses of their own choice.

The stockpile participant may stockpile any combination of stockpile grade rice as long as the required stockpile quantity is met.  
  
**Prescribed Stockpile Quantity**

The prescribed stockpile quantity depends on the type of stockpile grade rice imported:

|  | White Rice | Parboiled, Ponni and Basmati Rice |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Prescribed Stockpile Quantity** | 2 times of MIQ  | *2 times of average of 6 months' import quantity* or *5 MT*, whichever is higher |

**Storage of PSQ Rice**

The rice shall not be kept in the warehouse for more than a year to preserve freshness. 
  
For all rice consignments, importers are to submit declarations for rice imports and exports. Rice importers can sell either to wholesalers or directly to retailers. The stockpile participants may establish their own local distribution network.  
  
For rice traders who purely deal with wholesaling business, they shall hold a valid wholesale license.
