**Stockpile Grade Rice**

Importers of these types of rice for local distribution must join the RSS as licensed stockpile participants:
- White Rice*
- Parboiled Rice 
- Ponni Rice 
- Basmati Rice 

*Refers to all rice that is white in colour and not broken 

All other types of rice such as glutinuous rice, brown rice, red rice etc. do not need to be stockpiled with the RSS. However, a license is still required to import the rice into Singapore.  Refer [here](-) for more information on the rice licences available.
