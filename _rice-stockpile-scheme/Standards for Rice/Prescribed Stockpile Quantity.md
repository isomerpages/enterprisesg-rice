**What is Prescribed Stockpile Quantity?**
   

All stockpile participants are obliged to keep a Prescribed Stockpile Quantity (PSQ) in the government-designated warehouses. The Rice Stockpile belongs to the individual stockpile participant, although the Government has the right to acquire the rice (with compensation) during an emergency. Apart from the Prescribed Stockpile Quantity that is kept in the government-designated warehouse, the stockpile participants may keep their trading stocks at warehouses of their own choice.

**Prescribed Stockpile Quantity**

The prescribed stockpile quantity depends on the type of stockpile grade rice imported:

|  | White Rice | Parboiled, Ponni and Basmati Rice |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Prescribed Stockpile Quantity** | 2 times of MIQ  | *2 times of average of 6 months' import quantity* or *5 MT*, whichever is higher |
