**Stockpile Grade Rice**

Under RSS, there are four types of rice classified as stockpile grade rice: 
1. White Rice
2. Parboiled Rice 
3. Ponni Rice 
4. Basmati Rice 

**Monthly Import Quantity (MIQ) **

The MIQ depends on the type of stockpile grade rice imported:


|  | White Rice | Parboiled, Ponni and Basmati Rice |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| MIQ | Minimum 50 MT per month   | No minimum import quota but maximum import quota is set based on past 6 months' imports  |

*MT = Metric Ton
