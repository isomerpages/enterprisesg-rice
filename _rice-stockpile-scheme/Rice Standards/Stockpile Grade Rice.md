**What is Stockpile Grade Rice?**

Importers of these types of rice for local distribution must join the RSS as licensed stockpile participants:
- White Rice*
- Parboiled Rice 
- Ponni Rice 
- Basmati Rice 

*Refers to all rice that is white in colour and not broken 

All other types of rice such as glutinuous rice, brown rice, red rice etc. do not need to be stockpiled with the RSS. However, a license is still required to import the rice into Singapore.  Refer [here](-) for more information on the rice licences available.

**Why are these the four types of Stockpile Grade Rice?**

White rice, Basmati rice, Ponni rice and Parboiled rice accounts for about 90% of the total national consumption for rice. The stockpile scheme ensures that there is an adequate supply of rice in the market.
