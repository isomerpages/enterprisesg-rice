**What is Stockpile Grade Rice?**

| |
| -------- | 
| 1. White Rice^
2. Parboiled Rice
3. Ponni Rice
4. Basmati Rice 

*^White Rice refers to all type of rice that is white, without having other ingredients added*.

All other types of rice such as glutinuous rice, brown rice, red rice and other types ofÂ rice that do not fall within the scope of stockpile grade rice, are not considered stockpile grade rice and hence, do not need to participate in the RSS.  However, a licence is still required to import the rice into Singapore.  Refer [here](-) for more information on the rice licences available.

**Why are these the four types of Stockpile Grade Rice?**

White rice, Basmati rice, Ponni rice and Parboiled rice accounts for about 90% of the total national consumption for rice. The stockpile scheme ensures that there is an adequate supply of rice in the market.
