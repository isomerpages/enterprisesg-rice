**When will I see these codes?**
After submitting a permit application on TradeNet Portal, do wait 3-4 working days for the status to be updated. 

**What are the types of codes?**

There are three categories of codes: Approval (A), Pending (P) and Rejected (R). If an Approval code is reflected, no further action is required on your end.
