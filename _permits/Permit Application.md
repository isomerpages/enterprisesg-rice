**What is a rice permit required for?**

For all rice consignments, importers are to submit permit declarations for rice imports and exports via the TradeNet® System. Click [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.jsp) to access the TradeNet® page.

Rice importers can sell either to wholesalers or directly to retailers. The stockpile participants may establish their own local distribution network.
