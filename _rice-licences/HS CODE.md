      <td>The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System is commonly known as the &ldquo;Harmonized System&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;HS Code&rdquo;. It&nbsp;is an international standardized numerical method for classification of goods. The HS is not only used as a basis for Customs tariff and compilation of international trade statistics but also for various purposes including international trade negotiations, determination of the origin of the goods and monitoring of controlled goods.
