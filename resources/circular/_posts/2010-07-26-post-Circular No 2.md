  Dear Sir/Mdm
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>STOCKPILE OF BASMATI, PARBOILED AND PONNI RICE W.E.F. 1 APRIL 2010</strong>
  <br />
  <br />
  1. In our circular dated 22 March 2010, we have informed that Basmati, Parboiled and Ponni rice will be included in the Rice Stockpile Scheme (RSS) wef 1 April 2010. The Stockpile Quantity for Basmati, Parboiled and Ponni rice is twice the average monthly import and the Stockpile Quantity is to be stored in Singapore Storage &amp; Warehouse Pte Ltd (SSW).
  <br />
  <br />
  2. Importers, who are licensed to import rice before the implementation of Life-time Licensing, are given a 1-year grace period from 1 April 2010 to build up the Stockpile Quantity. The Stockpile Quantity, as determined based on the formula stated in Paragraph 1 of this circular, must be stored in SSW by 31 March 2011. All such importers are, however, encouraged to begin stockpiling upon commencement of the scheme ie 1 April 2010.
  <br />
  <br />
  3. New importers who are issued licenses after the implementation of lifetime licensing shall keep their Stockpile Quantity in SSW with effect from 1 April 2010. The 1-year grace period does not apply to these importers.
  <br />
  <br />
  4. We apologise for any inconveniences caused. Please feel free to contact me or Christopher Tan if you need further clarifications. The contact details are:
