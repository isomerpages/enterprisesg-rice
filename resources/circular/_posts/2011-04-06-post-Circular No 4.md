<h1>CIRCULAR NO 4&nbsp;
</h1>
<p>Circular No 4
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  6 April 2011
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  All Importers
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>STOCKPILE OF BASMATI, PARBOILED AND PONNI RICE</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  1. In our Circular No. 2/2010 dated 26 July 2010, we have informed all importers to keep your required stockpile quantity of Basmati, Parboiled and Ponni rice in SSW by 31 March 2011. We understand that there are some delays with rice exports in India. In view of this, we are pleased to inform you that we will extend the dateline from 31 March 2011 to 30 April 2011 for all importers to keep your required stockpile quantity for Basmati, Parboiled and Ponni rice in SSW.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Importers will be deemed to have fulfilled the requisite Stockpile Quantity based on the combined total quantity of different types of stockpile grade rice which is deposited with SSW.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>LABELING FOR PRE-PACKED RICE</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  3. The Food (Amendment) Regulations 2011 will be amended with effect from 15 April 2011. The details of the amendments can be found on AVA’s website.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ava.gov.sg/NewsEvents/Circulars/2011/index.htm"><strong>http://www.ava.gov.sg/NewsEvents/Circulars/2011/index.htm</strong></a>. A&nbsp;<a target="blank" href="https://rice.enterprisesg.gov.sg/rss_public/Portals/0/RSS/Circular%20AVA%20-14%20Mar%202011%20Food%20(Amendment)%20Regulations%202011.pdf"><strong>copy of the circular</strong></a>&nbsp;is also attached for your reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  4. In this amendment, there are 2 changes which will have to be made on the labeling for pre-pack rice. The first change is for “whole grain” to be substituted by “whole kernel” and the second change is that each package of rice will have to be labeled with the “net quantity” instead of the “minimum quantity” of rice in the package.
  <br>
  <br>
  5. We understand that you need time to implement the changes and will grant a grace period of 6 months for you to continue importing the rice with the old labels and up to one year to sell the rice in the Singapore market. Therefore:
  <br>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The last day to import rice with labels that do not comply with the new requirements is 15 October 2011.</li>
  <li>The last day of sale of rice with labels that do not comply with the new requirements is 15 April 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>PERMIT DECLARATION</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  6. Currently, IE accepts 2 modes of providing invoices and documents supporting each rice permit declaration, either via fax or submission of scanned documents through the TradeNet system. To provide faster turnaround for permit processing, we will be streamlining the procedure for the submission of documents for rice permit declaration. Hence, we would like to encourage rice importers and your declaration agents to submit documents via the TradeNet system instead of fax. Our implementation date for all documents to be submitted via TradeNet system will be 1 July 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  7. We look forward to your cooperation and support. If you need any further clarifications, you can call Eric Koh at 64334950 or email your queries to&nbsp;<a target="blank" href="mailto:erickoh@iesingapore.gov.sg"><strong>erickoh@iesingapore.gov.sg</strong></a>.
