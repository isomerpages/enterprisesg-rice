CIRCULAR NO 10 

29 July 2013

All White Rice Import Licensees

COMBINATION OF MONTHLY IMPORT QUANTITY AND PRESCRIBED STOCKPILE QUANTITY FOR LICENSEES WHO IMPORT BOTH ‘WHITE RICE’ AND ‘PARBOILED RICE, BASMATI RICE AND PONNI RICE’

1.            This Circular only concerns licensees who import both ‘White rice’ and ‘Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni rice.’ These changes are not applicable to licensees who import solely ‘Parboiled Rice, Basmati Rice and Ponni Rice’. 

2.            Currently, licensees importing White Rice commit to a Monthly Import Quantity (MIQ) for white rice imports. The Prescribed Stockpile Quantity (PSQ) for White Rice is computed based on twice the MIQ. If these licensees also import ‘Parboiled Rice, Basmati Rice and Ponni Rice’, a separate PSQ will be computed based on twice the moving average of import over the past 12 months. There is also no MIQ requirement for ‘Parboiled Rice, Basmati Rice and Ponni Rice’.

3.            With effect from 1st January 2014, for any importer who imports both types of stockpile grade rice, there will be only one MIQ and PSQ. PSQ will be computed based on twice the MIQ. Importers are free to mix and match the types of stockpile-grade rice for fulfilment of MIQ and PSQ. The minimum MIQ remains at 50 MT.

4.            All other rules governing Rice Stockpile Scheme for White Rice shall apply to ‘Parboiled Rice, Basmati Rice and Ponni Rice’ as well.

5.            If you would like to change your MIQ in view of the change in regulations, you are advised to inform us by 23rd Dec 2013 via email iesingapore_rice@iesingapore.gov.sg. If we do not receive any response, the MIQ of December 2013 will be used for January 2014 and thereafter.

Annex A

Frequently Asked Questions


1.      I understand that recently there is a review of Rice Stockpile Scheme for Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice and the changes will also take effect on 1st January 2014. The instructions between this Circular (No. 10) and Circular No. 9 are very different with regards to regulations imposed. Which one should I adhere to?

‘Circular 9’ is for Licensees who import ‘Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice’ and do not have a license to import ‘White Rice’. For those who import BOTH ‘White Rice’ and ‘Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice’, the regulations stipulated in this Circular shall apply.


2.      Will the minimum 50-MT MIQ be raised with this change?

No. The minimum MIQ will remain as 50 MT.

 

3.      From now till 1st Jan 2014, what is the computation method for PSQ?

PSQ will be computed as per current computation method, i.e. ‘White Rice’ based on twice the MIQ and ‘Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice’ based on twice the moving average. The PSQ you are required to fulfil is the sum of the two PSQs.

 

4.      As per current practice, when I export White Rice, I will have to apply for ‘Conversion of MIQ’ and replace this rice in due course. Do I have to do the same now that White Rice and Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice are inter-changeable in MIQ and PSQ?

Yes, as ‘Parboiled, Basmati and Ponni Rice’ are now included in the fulfilment of MIQ, you will have to replace them as per current regulations under the Rice Stockpile Scheme.

 

5.      How frequently can I change MIQ?

You may request for change of MIQ once a month. However, you would need to obtain approval from IE Singapore before 25th of the month for the change to take effect the following month.
