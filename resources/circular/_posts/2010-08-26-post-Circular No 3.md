  Dear Sir/Mdm
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>REVIEW OF STORAGE CHARGES AT RICE WAREHOUSE</strong>
  <br />
  <br />
  1. SINGAPORE STORAGE &amp; WAREHOUSES (&ldquo;SSW&rdquo;) PTE LTD has taken steps to address feedback from rice traders regarding weevil infestation of rice stored at its warehouses. The frequency of fumigation has been increased from 7 times a year to 10 times a year since October 2009. We have received feedback from importers under the Rice Stockpile Scheme that with increased fumigation, the weevil infestation problem is now under control.
  <br />
  <br />
  2. The additional cost of fumigation has led to an increase in operating costs for SSW. As such, the Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry has approved an increase in storage charges of $0.38 per MT per month.
  <br />
  <br />
  3. SSW will be notifying you shortly on the new storage charges.
  <br />
