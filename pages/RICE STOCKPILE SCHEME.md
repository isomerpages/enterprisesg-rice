<strong>Rice Stockpile Scheme (RSS)</strong>

			<td>The Rice Stockpile Scheme (RSS) is operated under the legal framework of the Price Control Act (Cap 244) and the Price Control (Rice) Order 1990 issued by the Minister for Trade and Industry.<br>
			<br>
			All stockpile grade rice importers are required&nbsp;to apply for a licence and&nbsp;participate in the Rice Stockpile Scheme. This Scheme ensures an adequate supply of rice in the market.<br>
			<br>
			Under the RSS, all White Rice, Basmati Rice, Ponni Rice and Parboiled Rice are classified as stockpile grade rice. Importers of these types of rice for local distribution must join the RSS as licensed stockpile participants.</td>

<strong>Monthly Import quantity (MIQ)</strong>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>For import of white rice, stockpile participants have to pre-commit on the quantity that they wish to import monthly for local distribution, this quantity is known as Monthly Import Quantity (MIQ).<br>
			<br>
			For import of white rice, the minimum MIQ is 50 tonnes.<br>
			<br>
			For import of basmati, parboiled and ponni rice, there is no minimum MIQ.</td>

<strong>Stockpile Quantity (SQ)</strong>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
	<tbody>
<tr>
			<td>All stockpile partcipants are obliged to keep a Prescribed Stockpile Quantity (PSQ) in the government-designated warehouses. <br>
			<br>
			The PSQ is twice the MIQ for white rice.  The PSQ for basmati, parboiled and ponni rice is computed based on twice the average import quantity for the preceding period of 6 months or 5MT, whichever is higher.<br>
			<br>
			The stockpile participant may stockpile any combination of stockpile grade rice as long as the required stockpile quantity is met.<br><br>
			The rice shall not be kept in the warehouse for more than a year.<br><br>
			The Rice Stockpile belongs to the individual stockpile participant, although the Government has the right to acquire the rice (with compensation) during an emergency.<br><br>
			Apart from the Prescribed Stockpile Quantity that is kept in the government-designated warehouse, the stockpile participants may keep their trading stocks at warehouses of their own choice.<br><br>
			For all rice consignments, importers are to submit declarations for rice imports and exports. Rice importers can sell either to wholesalers or directly to retailers. The stockpile participants may establish their own local distribution network.<br><br>
			For rice traders who purely deal with wholesaling business, they shall hold a valid wholesale license.<br><br>
