**When does a Rice Licence need to be terminated?**

If a business entity or company with an existing rice licence no longer needs the licence or is no longer active, they should terminate their rice licence.

**What does termination of a Rice Licence entail?**

Upon termination of licence, a 3-month notification period will be given. During this period, you are required to:
* sell or dispose **half** of your stockpile quantity of rice **within 2-month** of the notification and 
* the **remaining** before the **end of the 3-month period**. 

Your business entity or company and directors will also be subjected to a 6-month blackout period where no new rice licence(s) can be applied.
