**When does a Rice Licence need to be terminated?**

If a business entity or company with an existing Rice Licence **no longer needs the licence or no longer on a going-concern basis***, they should terminate their Rice Licence.

*Kindly submit the Rice Licence termination application before submitting an application to ACRA to change the entity's status.

**What does termination of a Rice Licence entail?**

Upon termination of licence, a 3-month notification period will be given. During this period, you are required to:
* sell or dispose **half** of your stockpile quantity of rice **within 2-month** of the notification and 
* the **remaining** before the **end of the 3-month period**. 

Your business entity or company and directors will also be subjected to a 6-month blackout period where no new Rice Licence(s) can be applied.

Please arrange the 3-month notification period for rice disposal/sale of rice with the designated warehouse provider.
